<h1>Phong Shaders - Ray Tracer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the implementation of Phong shading, a widely used technique in computer graphics for rendering realistic lighting effects on 3D surfaces. 
Phong shading enhances the visual realism of 3D objects by simulating the way light interacts with surfaces. Its lighting uses three key components:
<br />

- <b>Ambient Lighting:</b> Simulates background light that uniformly illuminates the object from all directions.

- <b>Diffuse Lighting:</b> Models the way light spreads across rough surfaces. It calculates how much light hits a surface based on the angle between the light source and the surface's normal.

- <b>Specular Lighting:</b> Produces the shiny highlights seen on glossy surfaces. This is based on the reflection of light, depending on the viewing angle, the light source, and the object's surface.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C++</b> 
  - SFML (Multi Media Library)

<h2>Demo:</h2>
